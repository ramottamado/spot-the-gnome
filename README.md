# WinSpotlightKDE
A utility for automatically downloading Windows Spotlight images, and setting them as your desktop, lock screen, and display manager background in KDE.

This project is specific to systems using systemd running KDE and using SDDM as the display manager, such as Kubuntu and Manjaro KDE. However, with a little work, it could easily be modified to work with other desktop environments or display managers, or with an alternative to systemd timers such as cron.
